# python excerscise

Write a small interactive python utility that calculates matrix multiplication.
None of the variables are passed as arguments, everything will be handled at runtime, please see the
example run (user inputs are in red):

$ ./mx_mul.py
Matrix A
width: 2
height: 3

Matrix B
width: 1
height: 2

Matrix A values:
1 2
5 3
6 7

Matrix B values:
5
1

Result:
7
28
37


Write the utility in a way that youâ€™d write a production code, use python3 without any mathematical
libraries (like numpy), if you are familiar with pytest, use test driven development approach and attach all
tests created during development.
Good luck.
